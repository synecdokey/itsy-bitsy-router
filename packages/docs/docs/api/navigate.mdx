# navigate

Function returned by [`useNavigate`](/hooks#useNavigate).

```js
const navigate = useNavigate();
```

## to: string

The first argument is the url to navigate to, provided as a string. Leave empty
to navigate to the same page.

```js
const navigate = useNavigate();
navigate("/home");
```

## opts: {state: object, replace: boolean}

The second argument is an optional object containing `state` and `replace` keys.

`state` is an optional object representing the state to provide to the `history`
object.

```js
const navigate = useNavigate();
navigate("/checkout", { state: { promoCode: "ABC" } });
```

`replace` is an optional boolean that when `true` overrides the current entry in
the browser history rather than creating a new one.

```js
const navigate = useNavigate();
navigate("/checkout", { replace: true });
```
