# itsy-bitsy-router

itsy-bitsy-router is a client-side routing solution for React apps that is
lighter than most. It is leveraging the lack of Internet Explorer support and
React hooks to stay as lightweight as possible.

## Why use it?

If IE11 is not part of your requirements, huge gains on bundle size can be
achieved. This is especially important for a router, which is always part of
your initial payload.
